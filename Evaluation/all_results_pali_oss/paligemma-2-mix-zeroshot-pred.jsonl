According to rubric: For descriptive answers: both action and target must be correct for 4–5, else <=3. Here target is correct? The target is the structure: blood vessel. But the reference is cystic artery, which is a blood vessel. The prediction is not specific. The rubric says both action and target must be correct for 4–5. The action? Not sure. But likely it's not fully correct. So score 3? Let's interpret: The prediction is partially correct: core idea right but missing details. So score 3. Reason: \"General category correct, lacks specificity.\" Must be <=20 words.
